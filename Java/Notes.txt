The menstrual cycle is the monthly process the female body goes through to prepare for a possible pregnancy. Counted from day one of menstrual bleeding up to the day before the next period starts again...
lasts from 21 to 35 days, average of 28 days.
**Menstrual phase(Days 1 - 5 approximately).
**Follicular phase(Day 1 - 13 approximately).
**Ovulation phase(around day 14 in an average cycle (28)) and day 16 in a 30 days cycle.
**Luteal phase(Day 15 - 28 approximately)
fertile window ~ 5days <= ovulation day

Example(for 28 days cycle)
period - Aug 1 - 5;
Fertile window - August 10 - 15
Ovulation - August 14 - 15
Next period - August 29
...excluding many other factors that may affect the cycle

My app would should ask for last period date and average cycle length
Estimate ovulation by subtracting 14 days from the expected next period
Calculate fertile window = ovulation - 5 
Show less fertile as the estimated safe and maybe i add a warning too
I can educate users with notes like: 
        "Your fertile window is estimated, not exact"
        "Irregular cycles reduce accuracy fertile window is estimated, not exact"
